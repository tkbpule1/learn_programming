<h1>Welcome to Learning to Program</h1>

<p>
	This will soon have a large collection of resources and great examples. 
	My hope is that someone new to programming can come here and learn a lot of great 
	information about multiple programming languages; from a single website.
	I have learned that the hardest part about trying to learn programming is finding
	good sources.  I will try my best to list all the resources that I have found useful
	for a particular programming language on the Home page of the said language.
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>No programming language is perfect.  There is not even a single best language;
	there are only languages well suited or perhaps poorly suited for particular purposes.
	--Herbert Mayer</blockquote>

<p>
	So far, I have read <em>C++ Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design</em> By
	Shelly Malik (Third Edition) published 2007.  I have also read
	<a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em></a>
	by Michael Hartl.
</p>

<p>
	I am running a Debian-based Linux OS, Ubuntu, on a custom built desktop.  I do not use 
	IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).  I use the terminal and Vim.  I
	am about six months into my programming journey.  I have been jumping around
	between C, C++, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, and Bash.
