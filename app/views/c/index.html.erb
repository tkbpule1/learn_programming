<h1>C Programming</h1>
<p>
	C is a high-level language, yet it provides capabilities that enable the
	user access to the hardware and deal with the system at a much lower level.
	C is a general-purpose structured programming language and was originally
	designed with systems programming applications in mind and provides the user
	with an enormous amount of power and flexibility.  </p>

<p>
  To compile the source code, using the gcc compiler:
</p>

<div class="code">
  <span class="prompt">$ </span>
  gcc test.c
</div>

<p>
  Note: The output file will be a.out.
</p>

<p>
  If you wish to to name the output something meaningful, use the gcc compiler
  with the option -o, the output file name, the file name of the source code:
</p>

<div class="code">
  <span class="prompt">$ </span>
  gcc -o test.exe test.c
</div>

<p>There are a few options with the gcc compiler that are useful:</p>

<div class="code">
	<span class="prompt"></span>$ </span>gcc -Wall test.exe test.c
</div>

<p>
  Now, we can execute the source code:
</p>

<div class="code">
  <span class="prompt">$ </span>
  ./test.exe
</div>
