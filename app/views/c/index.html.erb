<h1>C Programming</h1>
<p>
    C is a high-level language, yet it provides capabilities that enable the user access to the hardware and deal with the system at a much lower level. C is a general-purpose structured programming language and was originally designed with systems programming applications in mind and provides the user with an enormous amount of power and flexibility.
