<h1>C Programming</h1>
<p>
    C is a high-level language, yet it provides capabilities that enable the user access to the hardware and deal with the system at a much lower level. C is a general-purpose structured programming language and was originally designed with systems programming applications in mind and provides the user with an enormous amount of power and flexibility.

<p>
  To compile the source code, using the gcc compiler:
</p>

<div class="code">
  <span class="prompt">$ </span>
  gcc test.cpp
</div>

<p>
  Note: The output file will be a.out.
</p>

<p>
  If you wish to to name the output something meaningful, use the g++ compiler with the option -o, the output file name, the file name of the source code:
</p>

<div class="code">
  <span class="prompt">$ </span>
  gcc -o test.exe test.cpp
</div>

<p>
  Now, we can execute the source code:
</p>

<div class="code">
  <span class="prompt">$ </span>
  ./test.exe
</div>
</main>
</div>
