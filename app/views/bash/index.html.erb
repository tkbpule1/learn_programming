<h1>Bash Scripting</h1>


<p> This is a collection of information from many sources, which I will list at
the bottom of this page. I did not write it.  </p> <br> <br> <br>

<p> The shell is a command interpreter. More than just the insulating layer
between the operating system kernel and the user, it's also a fairly powerful
programming language. A shell program, called a script, is an easy-to-use tool
for building applications by "gluing together" system calls, tools, utilities,
and compiled binaries. Virtually the entire repertoire of UNIX commands,
utilities, and tools is available for invocation by a shell script. If that were
not enough, internal shell commands, such as testing and loop constructs, lend
additional power and flexibility to scripts. Shell scripts are especially well
suited for administrative system tasks and other routine repetitive tasks not
requiring the bells and whistles of a full-blown tightly structured programming
language.  </p>
